<h3>The App that answers that question</h3>

<p>WFD was created to help solve the problem of generating some good dinner ideas. In our busy lives, if you're anything like me, you come to the end of the day and everyone is asking what's for dinner? At this point I have very little left to give so having an app to lean on would be a dream. </p>

<h3>Development Plan</h3>
Run through possible User Stories
Map out the App- how many pages, what components will be used, what technologies are needed?
Psuedo-code
Wireframe
Fetch successfully from my external API
Achieve full CRUD capability
React Router through my 3 pages
Sass and style
Deploy to Heroku


<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>Heroku</li>

<h3>MVP</h3>
    <li>At least one model utilizing FULL CRUD</li>
    <li>Pulling from a 3rd Party API</li>
   <li><Deployed on Heroku/li>
 
 <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
 <li>React Router</li>
 <li>Portfolio Level Styling</li>
 
 <h3>Challenges</h3>
 <p>Working with the shape of my data! Pulling from my API returned an object with an array of objects nested inside. This ate up a ton of my time and I was only able to overcome it with the help of my cohorts.</p>
